# Mock social media platform

*React-based frontend prototype, resembling the Facebook News Feed, that demystifies Facebook data collection methods through a real-time log of data collection.*

This prototype demonstrates tracking of a few basic kinds of data:
- likes on posts
- exact timing and duration of viewing posts
- client device/browser info and location

As a proof-of-concept, this prototype consists only of filler data right now.

## How to run

After cloning the repo, install dependencies with `npm install`.

Then, use `npm run` to run the app in development mode, on a local web server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
